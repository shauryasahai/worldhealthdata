The visualization is inspired by [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) to display world health data. The visualization is made up of three views: the map, the scatterplot, and the info box. 

The **map** provides geospatial context. Countries are color-coded by region and can be selected. 

The **scatterplot** is also color-coded by region, with selectable country bubbles. The data shown along the scatterplot axes are chosen from two drop-down menus. A third drop-down allows the user to choose the data that maps to the size of the bubbles. Below the drop-down menus is a range slider that changes the data to reflect a specified year. 

The **info box** shows basic information about the selected country.

When a country is selected in either the map or the scatterplot, the country is highlighted in both views and the info box will show data about that country.
